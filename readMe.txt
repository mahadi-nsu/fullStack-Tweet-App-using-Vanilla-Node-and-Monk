Its a full Stack Application where one can send tweet and see all other tweets.
I made two different folder-
   1)Client
   2)Server
Here client and server works independently. A static server for client and a express server for server. 

Used Technologies
  1) vanilla js for front end.
  2)Node ( Express) for Back end.
  3)Monk(MongoDB) for data store.
